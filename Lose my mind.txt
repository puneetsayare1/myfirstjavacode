Bounce back when bottles is on me
I'm pushin' a new pen, rewritin' the story
Hello to my old ways, goodbye to the nosebleeds
You fightin' to stay here, you probably ODin'
Ain't finna pop for no reason
I don't throw shots, I run legions
I been goin' over the top where no queen been
Die with no regrets, this is my season
Itch to pull trigger, gift that keep givin'
